# Welcome to your addon

1. Start coding! Just open up the .py file in this folder and create what you would like Kodi to do! If you're tring to do a plugin, please check out [this kodi routing framework](https://github.com/tamland/kodi-plugin-routing)
2. Write some tests, maybe? We've created a test folder for that, otherwise just delete it ;)
3. You might want to look at your `addons.xml` it should already be filled, but you will need to understand what your doing and might want to fill in some more info. So read up [here](http://kodi.wiki/view/Addon.xml).
4. Do you want some settings for your addon? Check the `settings.xml` in the resources folder. And read up [here](http://kodi.wiki/view/Settings.xml).
5. Read [this info](http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_structure#icon.png) and drop an icon for your addon into the `resource` folder and name it `icon.png`.
6. Read [this](http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_structure#fanart.jpg) and drop a addon background into the `resource` folder and name it `fanart.jpg`.
7. End up with a beautiful Kodi addon! Good for you :) Maybe you want to [share it with us](http://kodi.wiki/view/Submitting_Add-on_updates_on_Github)?
